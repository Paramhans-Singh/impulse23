                <h3>Registration Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Registration of teams must be done by a
                    <strong>Team Leader</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can register under any single track mentioned in the
                    brochure/rulebook, however only one registration per team is
                    Allowed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Participation Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    All work on a project should be done during the hackathon.
                    But the teams can plan their basic layout before the
                    hackathon. The github repository will be created during the
                    hackathon.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the offline rounds of the Hackathon, participants
                    will be required to remain on campus until 5 pm on the first
                    day. Following this, they can leave and return the next day
                    at 9 am.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can use any libraries, frameworks, or open-source code
                    in their projects. Working on a project before the event and
                    open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code
                    during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is
                    not allowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams
                    are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs
                    after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find
                    a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few
                    lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes
                    or adding new features is not allowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the
                    organizers' discretion.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mentors will be provided during the hackathon for solving
                    the doubts of participants.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No team member is allowed to register under more than one
                    team.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    at campus in Round 2 and 3 (if selected further).
